# nearest-station

A little side project.

Goals:

- By postcode or user's location, list the nearest rail/tube(/DLR/etc.) station(s)
- Maybe provide a slider for distance
- Checkbox to filter by station with quickest connection to a London terminus/"major" station
- Maybe allow a preferred terminus to be set
- Provide a link so that the user can jump to maps for navigation
- Maybe support postcode autocompletion
- Show loading message while fetches are doing their thing
- Decorate with mode-of-transport logos if available
- Specify journey times (and distances) if available
- Consider London vs non-London(!)
